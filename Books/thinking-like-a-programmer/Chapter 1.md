Today I started working through 'Thinking Like A Programmer'

I finished the first puzzle and wrote the following notations for it.

# Chapter One
---
A farmer with a fox, a goose, and a sack of corn needs to cross a river. The farmer has a rowboat, but there is room for only the farmer and one of his three items. 

Unfortunately, both the fox and the goose are hungry. The fox cannot be left alone with the goose, or the fox will eat the goose. 

Likewise, the goose cannot be left alone with the sack of corn, or the goose will eat the corn. 

How does the farmer get everything across the river?

## Items In Play
* Farmer 
* Fox
* Goose
* Sack of Corn
* Rowboat

---
## Stipulations
* Fox cannot be left alone with goose
* Goose cannot be left alone with the sack of corn
* The farmer can only take one item across at a time

---
## Expectation
* Farmer gets everything accross the river

---
## Key Elements that aren't explicit that make the puzzle hard
* The farmer can take multiple trips across
* The farmer can take items back and forth

---
## Possible solutions
1. The goose eats the corn and the fox eats the goose resulting in all three items technically coming across
2. Farmer takes across the goose, farmer takes accross -- Roadblock because the farmer cant leave the goose with the corn or the fox
   * You can surpass that roadblock by taking the goose, going back and picking up the fox and drop the fox on the other side, and then pick the goose back up, and go across again, and pick up the sack of corn, and dropping off the corn with the fox and then going back to get the goose and bringing the goose back accross
