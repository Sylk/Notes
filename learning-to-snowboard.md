## Snowboarding

### Mountain Resorts

Before even jumping on a board, you'll need to know where you're going to try and go snowboarding. In Colorado there are many ways you can decide what spots you'll hit.

The easiest way to scattershot and collect many passes to visit new places is to grab either an [Ikon Season Pass](https://www.ikonpass.com/) or the [Epic Season Pass](https://www.epicpass.com/). They are both good for a singular season, and both have different areas.

Notable mountains for myself in the Ikon pass are Copper Mountain, Winter Park Resort, Steamboat.

While Epic Pass provides access to KeyStone, Breckenridge, and 10 days at Vail.

I personally chose the Ikon Pass due to the quality being much better and  the prices remaining nearly identical when you buy the local passes.

### Back Country

This is a topic I'm not fairly familiar with, and will add info when learning more. Until then, I have this excerpt.

Going to the backcountry is something that can be done once you've passed the test of truly being able to work on the main mountain in resorts.
